## ArchLinux From Scratch

This is a book for the pragmatic GNU/Linux user, who wants to get a good
foundation in GNU/Linux.

Intended audience:

* future techies: programmers, sysadmins, geeks
* curent MS Windows users, who want to learn some GNU/Linux before installing
  it on their real system
* current GNU/Linux users, who want to get more insight on how things work
  under the hood, but don't have the time or energy to follow
  [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

## Why ArchLinux, and not Distro X?

Because ArchLinux is simple, clean, and it relies more on the upstream programs
being used than its own patches and configurations. When you learn ArchLinux,
you pretty much learn to deal with GNU/Linux in general - with any distribution.

Also because ArchLinux is lean and the reader can turn it afterwards in
whatever he desires: a desktop machine, a server, a testing machine, etc.
